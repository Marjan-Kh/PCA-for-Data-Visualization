#### Principal Component Analysis for Data Visualization

One of the application of PCA is for Data Visualization. 

During this exercise one can understand how *dimensionality reduction* is achieved using PCA, and how PCA is used in visualization. For that purpose, I start with a simple explanation of PCA on IRIS dataset [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/pca-using-python-scikit-learn-e653f8989e60). 

#### Dimensionality Reduction
It is one of the parameters that affects data visualization. It becomes easier to visualize the data when reduced to very low dimensions. This is because in general we need to deal with very high dimensional data, so in that case it wont be possible to visualize such data, which need enough computation power. Briefly, it reduces the time and storage space required. Dimensionality Reduction is achieved by reducing the number of random variables through obtaining a set of principal variables. 

#### Standardization
Standardization is a process of scaling data. One need to scale the features in data before applying PCA in dealing with the different scale issues present in the dataset.
